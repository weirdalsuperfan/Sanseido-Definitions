A NOTE ON DEPENDENCIES: This currently requires the [Japanese Support addon](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3918629684) and the [the developer version of the NHK accent addon](https://github.com/weirdalsuperfan/nhk-pronunciation/tree/patch-1).

After installing those, to install this addon, simply copy the two files in the Sanseido-Definitions folder into your Anki addons folder. Copy the two files, not the folder, i.e. place the files at the top level of the addons folder - but if you already have a bs4 folder in your addons folder, do not overwrite it; just leave it as is.

# Sanseido Definitions Plugin for Anki

This is a plugin for [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), an open source flashcard system. It pulls simplified J-J definitions from [sanseido.net](http://www.sanseido.net)'s デイリーコンサイス国語辞典 (Daily Concise Kokugo Jiten). This is a fork from the original, the AnkiWeb page of which can be found [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1967553085).

## Usage

The plugin relies on having 2 fields,
  * Expression - The Japanese word/words/setence to look up on sanseido
  * Sanseido - The field to insert the definition (annotated with 振り仮名) into

If you'd like to change the names of these fields, edit lines 25-26 in sanseidoDefsForAnki.py

To add definitions, find the card in the browser window, and click Edit > Regenerate Sanseido definitions

## Help on reading the definitions

Sanseido has some nice [辞書凡例](http://www.sanseido.biz/main/Dictionary/Hanrei/dailyJJ.aspx) (Dictionary explanatory notes) for デイリーコンサイス国語辞典. Explanation on the symbols and abbreviations used can be found in section 9, 記号・略語一覧.

## Bugs?
If bs4 does not work for you, report it on here and I will upload the version I personally use (this is a fork, but the original only used a partial bs4).

Also report any bugs with parsing multiple words on this page.

Report other bugs and issues to the original plugin GitHub page [here](https://github.com/kqueryful/Sanseido-Definitions).
